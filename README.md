## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML and CSS, and basic JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## How I did it

First I download the starter files which contains the all the designs the instructions on how to build the site.
After which I immediately start coding **ASAP** no waste of time.

**Best practices** 
- Like the use of variables for my css color, background, gap, font-size etc values.
- Function to select an element in the dom.
- Sematic Elements.
- Comments
- Readable classes

I use **no Framework** whatsoever everthing was pure from **vanilla javascript** to **pure html** and **pure css**.

If you are reading this and want to do the same like me, I will encourage you to give it a shot. You learn by doing, that's basically my phillosophy, and it's true you learn more when you practice whatever little knowledge you've gain.
